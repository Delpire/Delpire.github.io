  <p>This is my implementation of the SHA-1 Algorithm. I made this algorithm for the Reddit Daily Programmer challenge, and to learn more about how hash functions work. The subreddit dailyprogrammer is a subreddit where several programming challenges are posted throughout the week. This particular challenge was about using a hash function such as SHA-1. I decided that it would be more educational (and fun), to learn how the SHA-1 algorithm actually works. The reddit post can be found <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2ba46z/7252014_challenge_172_intermediate_breach/"><u>here</u></a> if you would like to read more about it.</p>
  <p>Hash algorithms are algorithms that take a plain text string and converts them into a random string or hash. Hashes are often used to store passwords in a database. This way, if a database containing passwords are hacked, the passwords remain safe. With this in mind, there are two key features needed for a good hash function. The first is that the function must only work in one direction, meaning that it is easy to take a string and hash it, but very difficult to take a hash and obtain the original string. The second feature is that it must be very difficult to find collisions. Collisions are two strings, that when put through the function, yield the same hash. In the case of using hashes for passwords, this means that no two passwords can obtain the same hash. No hash function is perfect, and finding algorithms that avoid collision is a very difficult task. SHA-1 is decent at both of these features, but has been deprecated due to better algorithms being developed. SHA-1 is also a very old algorithm and since computers consistently gain more memory and speed over time, programs have been written to crack SHA-1. Since I implemented SHA-1 as a learning experience rather than to use on a website, there is no issue with the algorithm being deprecated.</p>
  <p>SHA-1, like many hash algorithms, hashes strings through bit manipulation. The plaintext string is converted to its equivalent string of bits, receives some padding, and then goes through a long series of bit operations. In the end, the algorithm will yield a string of 160 bits or 40 characters. Any size original string will result in 40 characters, which is nice because the size of the final hash cannot be used to infer the size of the original string.</p>
  <p>I decided to write my SHA-1 function in Python. This was particularly challenging because it was one of the first few programs I had ever written in Python. This was a great learning experience because not only did I learn how SHA-1 works, but I also learned how to do bit manipulation in Python. Adding my function to the website also served as a bit of a challenge. Web pages use HTML, CSS, and Javascript, not Python. In order to give my website access to my python script, I decided to make use of websockets. Websockets are communication channels between a web page and another program. When you click the hash button above, your string is sent to my server, where it is passed off to my Python script. The server reads in the results of the script, and sends the hash back through the websocket, where it is then displayed on the page. This is similar to how entering a password would work on any other site. Once the server has the hash to your password, it compares it with the hash it has stored for your account. If these hashes match, then the server knows the correct password has been entered, and letâ€™s the user access their account.</p>
