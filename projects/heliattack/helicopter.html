              <h2>HeliAttack</h2>
              <p>I made this side scrolling game for a class I took at Kansas State Univerity. The project was separated into two parts. The first part was to create the foundation of the game. Get the helicoper animated and moving, take input to fire missles/bullets, and implement some basic collision detection. The second part of the project was to turn the foundation into an actual game. I added enemies with AI, levels with transition screens, music, sound effects and more.</p>
              <p>The biggest challenge in this project was implementing a Sweep and Prune collision system. Sweep and Prune (SAP) is an algorithm that looks at the endpoints of a collision box on a particular axis. As objects move through the world, their collision box moves with them. Each time the game updates, the collision system will sweep through an array of endpoints checking for possible collisions. Once a potential collision is found, more complicated collision calculations can be made. For example, the helicopter might be at an x position of 50 in the world. This means the left side of the helicopter could be at 40 while the right end is at 60. If any objects left or right position are inbetween these two points, then they could be colliding with the helicopter. Once this has been determined, the collision system can check the objects' y-coordinate to check if they are indeed colliding. This time of broad level analysis allows objects that obviously couldn't be colliding from checked. This reduces the number of complicated calculations, freeing up the CPU and improving the performance.</p>
              <p>Another learning experience was getting the opportunity to work with an artist. My cousin, Robin Delpire, is very interested in creating games, and one day he would like to work for a game company producing the artwork. When I received the project's requirements document, the first thing I did was send him a copy. Even though he is not a programmer, giving him my requirements allowed him to begin working on the assets that I needed to make the game. These requirements not only affected what he needed to create, but his art also affected how I needed to program various aspects of the game. For example, the boss at the end of the third level was different than the boss I planned to program. I had imagined a giant cruise ship with different cannons that needed to be destoryed. Instead, Robin created a cannon wall. So instead of having a moving ship guarding the exit, we created a stationary, multi-tiled boss that physically blocked the exit. The final challenge working with Robin was the language barrier. Robin is from Liege, Belgium, and French is his primary language. His English is quite good, but there some miscommunications throughout the project. This helped me learn to be more clear in my expectations and requirements. Speaking different languages, and viewing the game from different creative mindsets forced us to be patient and open minded. Sometimes he would need to recreate art assets, and other times I would have to alter my code. Overall, we struck a good balance, and creating the game with him was a very positive experience.</p>
