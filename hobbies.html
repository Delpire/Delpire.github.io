        <p>While computer engineering is very important to me, I believe having a strong work/life balance is important to being the best computer engineer I can be. I have many hobbies like watching my favorite shows on Netflix, or playing video games, but I think my most important hobby is music. Playing music has been a constant in my life, and I believe that this hobby strongly influenced my skills as a computer engineer.</p>

        <p>I grew up in the music city Nashville, Tennessee. Both my parents played a variety of instruments, and all of my friends did as well. So naturally I began taking guitar lessons in the 5th grade. It didn’t take me long to fall in love with the instrument, and I quickly drifted into playing rock n’ roll. I began playing in bands shortly after that. The music school I went to, would put us into bands, and have us play for our parents twice a year. At a very early age, I was performing on stage, increasing my confidence in front of an audience. In middle school I began forming my own bands, and in high school, music became my life. I teamed up with incredibly talented musicians, wrote music, played gigs, and even recorded. Since then I have played recitals, battle of the bands, charity events, bar gigs, and many, many more events.</p>

        <p>Through playing music, I have learned skills in public speaking, creating, and leadership. I have played music (and I’ve even done a little singing) in front of as few people as ten, and as many people as 200. Since I have been doing this from a very young age, I have a good amount of confidence when getting in front of an audience. Performing has strengthened my presentations over the years, and I really enjoy public speaking. My leadership skills improved by playing in many different bands. Over the years, I have played with a large variety of musicians, but in highschool, I was given the opportunity to create and lead my own band. This involved organizing band practices twice a week, and coordinating shows we were going to play. Decisions had to be made for how songs were structured and what order our setlist would be in. I did not make all the decisions, but I helped the band continue moving in a good direction.</p>

        <p>Today, even with my busy computer engineering life, I am still playing music and still playing in bands. Music is an absolute joy in my life, and I will be playing as long as I can.</p>
