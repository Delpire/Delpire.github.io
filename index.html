        <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website. My name is Chris Delpire and I am currently a senior in computer engineering at Kansas State Univeristy. The goal of this website is to tell you a little bit about who I am. Here you will learn what my engineering process looks like, the work experiences I have had, some of the fun projects I have created, and the hobbies that have had an impact on my career.</p>
        <p>I was very fortunate to be born in a math and science focused family. My father has a Ph.D. in Cell Physiology from the University of Li√®ge, and my mother has a Masters in Physiology and Biophyiscs from Wright State University. Science was usually a topic of discussion at the dinner table, and as I progressed through middle school and high school, my passion for math and science grew. Not only did I live in a science centric household, but my professors in highschool were excellent teachers and mentors. Coupled with a love for computers, I knew I wanted to be a computer engineer when I got to college.</p>
        <p>Looking back at my four years of college, choosing computer engineering was one of the best decisions I have made in my life. Computer engineering has helped me learn important skills when in comes to building and programming computers, but it has also satisfied my thirst for knowledge in science and math. Taking the engineering route, gave me the opportunity to learn some advanced physics (especially in regard to electromagnitism), as well as high level, theoretical mathematics.</p>
        <p>Computer engineering has also given me a new passion: programming. Throughout highschool, I always loved browsing the internet and playing games on my computer, but I had no real understanding of how everything worked under the hood. Several times throughout my life, I tried to learn programming on my own; however, with the vast amount of languages and resources out there, I didn't know where to start. Engineering gave me an incredible opportunity by teaching me how everything worked from the application layer all the way down to the bits. Throughout my journey I have learned about the electrical properties that allow computers to work, the binary mathematics needed, the machine code using those bits, and the high level, compiled languages being used today. While all those topics were exciting to learn, higher level programming really peaked my interested. I love the challenge in creating good software solutions that not only work, but run efficiently. To me, this is the exciting aspect of software development. There are often many ways to solve a problem, but finding an efficient, maintainable, and scalable solution is what makes programming exciting.</p>
        <p>My goal in computer engineering is very simple: to learn. I want to make software that helps improve our lives. I want to make software that is efficient, and fast. I want to make software that is fun. But in order to create software that does all of this, I need to continue to learn. Learning is what keeps me growing as a person, and it is what improves my code every time I sit at the computer. I know that if I continue to focus on learning, I will have a very successful career.</p>
